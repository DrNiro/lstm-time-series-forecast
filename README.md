# Deep Learning Time Series Forecast
This project is a deep learning solution for time series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks implemented with PyTorch. It leverages finance methodology to predict stock movements based on historical data and applies data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.

## Introduction
Time series forecasting is a critical component of financial analysis and decision-making. This project aims to provide a deep learning-based solution for predicting stock price movements, enabling investors and traders to make more informed decisions.

The core of this project is the LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excels in capturing sequential dependencies in time series data.
